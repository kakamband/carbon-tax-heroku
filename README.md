## Armchair Dissident Carbon Tax

### [Demo Heroku App](https://carbontax.herokuapp.com/)

A basic web app for calculating and logging the carbon output of transport.

Front end built in React, linked to a Django REST API backend.

Hosted on hobby-level Heroku server.

Currently utilising [Cors-Anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) to fetch Google Distance Matrix API from client side,
but will probably need to change this to use Google's Javascript API.
